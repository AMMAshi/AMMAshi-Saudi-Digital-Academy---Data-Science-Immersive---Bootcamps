# QUESTION: Build and simulate the expected profit to the casino of running different games 
# (craps, roulette, slot machines, whichever is your favorite)
# Hint: Stay away from poker since bluffing plays a critical role in the game and it has no effect on computer code

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Rules for Blackjack, Craps, Roulette: 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# player bets $1, if player win he/she gets his/her money back plus $1 #(casino loss $1) 
# if player loses he/she loses $1 # ( casino add one dollar)
# if a tie happens, player recovers her/his money # (gain and loses of zero to the casino)

# Simulate Casino Profits 
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Assuming everyone plays a perfect strategy
